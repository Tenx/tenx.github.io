Users face difficulties in natural movement control and environmental adaptation, while healthcare providers struggle to provide personalized adjustment and rehabilitation programs.","solution":"Through an intensive design thinking process, our interdisciplinary team developed an innovative sensor-based control system integrated with machine learning algorithms. The solution combines real-time motion sensors, EMG signal processing, and adaptive learning algorithms to create a more intuitive and responsive prosthetic control system. We implemented a mobile application for user feedback and adjustment, along with a cloud-based platform for healthcare provider monitoring and customization.","impact":"The project has significantly improved prosthetic limb user experience and adoption rates. Users report a 65% increase in control accuracy and a 40% reduction in adaptation time. The system's machine learning capabilities have enabled continuous improvement in movement prediction, while the mobile application has streamlined the adjustment process, reducing clinical visits by 30%. Healthcare providers now have access to detailed usage analytics for better patient support.","techStack":["Machine Learning","Sensor Tech","IoT","Data Analytics","Mobile App","User Research","Prototyping"],"imageUrl":"/projects/ottobock/thumbnail.jpg","children":["$","section",null,{"className":"space-y-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-4","children":"Design Process"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"relative h-[600px] w-full rounded-lg overflow-hidden","children":["$","$L3",null,{"src":"/projects/ottobock/design-process.png","alt":"Design Thinking Process","fill":true,"className":"object-contain"}]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-4","children":"Team Collaboration"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-4","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"relative h-[400px] w-full rounded-lg overflow-hidden","children":["$","$L3",null,{"src":"/projects/ottobock/co-working.jpg","alt":"Team Collaboration","fill":true,"className":"object-contain"}]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-600","children":"As part of the Product Builder Digital Health program, our team of 20 master's students from HPI and various universities in the Berlin-Brandenburg area collaborated to solve healthcare challenges.
